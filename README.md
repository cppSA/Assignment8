Assignment 8 in c++ course.

Input and output of board, and image in c++:
In this repository you will find 7 files regarding the seventh exercise given in CPP course. 
  - Cell.cpp - is the class we wrote with the code needed for the functionality of our class Board.
    Cell.h - is the header file with everything needed for our Cell.cpp code to work. 
  - OurException.cpp - contains two classes we wrote, with the code needed for the functionality of our class Board.
       1. The IllegalCharException class - is an exception for a character that is illegal.
       2. The IllegalCoordinateException class - is an exception when the coordinates given do not match the Board size. 
    OurException.h - is the header file with everything needed for our OurException.cpp code to work.
  - Board.cpp - is the class we wrote with the code needed for the functionality of our program. 
    Board.h - is the header file with everything needed for our code to work.
  - main.cpp - the main provided from the assignment's github.
  - Makefile - is makefile we wrote for compilation.

All 7 files were compiled and tested using the main included in this repository
(taken from: [homework](https://github.com/erelsgl/ariel-cpp-5778/tree/master/week06-inheritance/homework)).
